            <p><div class="blue">This short guide is intended to offer a guaranteed solution to any problem you may be having with your console or device.
            <br>It is failsafe, foolproof and works 100% of the time.</div>
            <hr><p>Here is the solution:
            <ol>
                <li>Stop doing it.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>It may sound counterproductive, but if you are having a problem trying to do something, no longer trying to do it will solve your problem. Here are a few examples.
            <ul>
                <li>If you are having trouble installing CFW on your console, stop trying to install CFW.</li>
                <li>If you are finding it difficult to repair a broken item, stop trying to repair it.</li>
                <li>If it is hard for you to reverse parallel park, stop trying to reverse parallel park.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I think by now you understand how easy it can be to solve any problem you have. Thank you for visiting eipHax.
