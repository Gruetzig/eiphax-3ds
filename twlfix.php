        <p>This is a page on how to fix your TWL firm, if it is broken.
		<br>What you need to use will depend on if you have no hacks, Homebrew or CFW.
		<br>Click whichever button is appropriate.

		<br>The easiest thing to do is to get Homebrew via Pichaxx and then use Homebrew-only TWLFix below.
		<br>To get Homebrew, go over to <a href="./frogminer">the Frogminer page</a> and click "I don't have a homebrew entry point", and follow the instructions there.
		<br>Once you have Homebrew, come back here and do the Homebrew-only method.
		<br>If, for some reason, you can't get Homebrew access, there is a stock-only option. It's a bit more complicated, and requires a DSiWare application from the eShop.
		<br>Once you've got a DSiWare application, our good friend MechanicalDragon has written us some instructions here: <a href="https://github.com/MechanicalDragon0687/TWLFix/wiki/Instructions">TWLFix</a>.
